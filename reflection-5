This week was not bad I did complete the sprint-5 which it was last week
sprint but it took a lot of time from because of the rich and heavy content
it's okay the only thing that will effect on is sprint-6 so hopefully I will manage
to finish that on time, I learnt the jQuery selectors "javascript selectors" and how
important when it comes to integrated it with html and CSS.


I the improvement can shown or done in documentation reading and doing
more practicing in using javascript selectors and using them more in our own
blogs.
